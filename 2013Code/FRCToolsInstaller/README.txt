README for FRC Tools Installer
===============================
The following dependencies are needed to run (or build) FRC Tools Installer:
   - PycURL
      On Windows, you can find binaries here:
      http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pycurl
   - urlgrabber (already included)
      We use https://github.com/excid3/urlgrabber instead of http://urlgrabber.baseurl.org/
      due to a bugfix included in this (relatively) newer release.
